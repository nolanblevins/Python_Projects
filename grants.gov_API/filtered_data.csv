FNDs are highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity, health care costs, and even mortality. In some respects, this group of conditions sits at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry, but the majority of cases first come to the attention of neurologists. Management is complex and requires interdisciplinary approaches. Given the disability caused by the symptoms, and the high cost in healthcare utilization and loss of productivity, FNDs amount to a significant missed opportunity for therapeutic intervention and therefore, a healthcare crisis. Diagnosis and management of FNDs remain very challenging. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed but they are not universally agreed upon. Diagnosis is based on positive clinical findings, and can be supported by laboratory or ancillary investigation findings. Certain FND subtypes are more difficult to correctly diagnose than others. More importantly, laboratory-supported diagnosis is possible, and biomarkers can be developed, but significantly more research is needed in these areas to advance clinical management of FNDs. Therapies exist and have been studied in select populations but gathering high-level evidence through clinical trials is hampered by limitations in available outcome measures. Differential responses to treatments have been recorded, and thus, prediction of aggregate treatment response has been difficult. This FOA invites researchers to submit prospective clinical projects that address critical needs for clinical trial readiness in FNDs.

It is a site of entry for HIV infected monocytes and macrophages that can traverse the BBB either paracellularly or transcellularly. HIV viral proteins can also attack astrocytes and tight junctions of BBB directly and compromise its integrity, resulting in the crossing of the virus, as well as abused substances, into the brain. Meanwhile, many substances of abuse cause BBB dysfunction. Because BBB integrity regulates both substances and virus levels in the brain, it is critical to establish the mechanisms by which HIV infection, in combination with substances of abuse, affect BBB function and integrity and their consequences. The purpose of this initiative is to support innovative research that elucidates the roles of HIV and addictive substances in the pathology of BBB. This FOA encourages studies to expand the current understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms underlying virus mobilization across BBB, and pathology of BBB in HIV infection and substance use disorders (SUD).

With the dual qualification of a rigorous scientist and clinician, graduates will be equipped with the skills to develop research programs that accelerate the translation of research advances to the understanding, detection, treatment, and prevention of human disease, and to lead the advancement of biomedical research. Areas of particular importance to NIGMS are optimizing training efficiency, fostering the persistence of alumni in research careers, and enhancing the diversity of the clinician-scientist workforce.

Collaboration Grants are awarded to collaborative teams (including at least two scholar-editors, in addition to one or more archivists, digital scholars, data curators, and/or other support and technical staff, as necessary) for collecting, describing, preserving, compiling, transcribing, annotating, editing, encoding, and publishing documentary source materials online. We strongly encourage applications from collaborative teams that include diverse faculty and staff in key positions, and that include editorial, archival, and technical staff at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic- and Minority-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and/or other Indigenous and Native American tribal scholars and community members, and institutions serving Asian American communities. We also encourage projects to seek out community members as well as undergraduate and graduate students to contribute to (and benefit from) participation in all phases of the project. **Notice of Funding Renewal Limitation: The NHPRC now limits the number of years it will support projects in this grant category. All projects seeking renewed funding are limited to a maximum of up to 10 years total funding support, beginning with and including any funds awarded for the FY 2022 funding year. (Funding years need not be consecutive.) Applicants seeking renewed funding in this grant category must demonstrate that they have successfully achieved the performance objectives associated with previous NHPRC awards; provide updated, current information, including a description of the new activities; describe the content and historical significance of the specific materials to be edited during the proposed grant period; show progress towards completing the edition; and justify costs in a new budget. Award Information A grant is for one year and for up to $125,000 per year. The Commission expects to make up to 35 grants in this category for a total of up to $4,000,000, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. Grants begin no earlier than January 1, 2024. The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all publications, publicity, and other products that result from its support. Eligibility ? U.S. nonprofit organizations or institutions ? U.S. colleges, universities, and other academic institutions ? State or local government agencies ? Federally-acknowledged or state-recognized Native American tribes or groups In order to ensure eligibility, applicants should first review the rules and regulations governing NHPRC grants under the Administering an NHPRC Grant section. Cost Sharing The total costs of a project are shared between the NHPRC and the applicant organization. Cost sharing is required. The applicant&apos;s financial contribution may include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. NHPRC grant recipients are not permitted to use grant funds for indirect costs (as indicated in 2 CFR 2600.101). Indirect costs must be listed under the applicant&apos;s cost sharing contribution if they are included in the budget. The Commission provides no more than 75 percent of total project costs in the Publishing Historical Records in Collaborative Digital Editions category. For example, a request of $75,000 in NHPRC grant funds means the applicant institution must provide at least $25,000 in cost share. Other Requirements Applicant organizations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting an application, maintain SAM registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid Unique Entity ID in their application. To register or request a Unique Entity ID, go to https://sam.gov. Already manage an entity that does business with the federal government? You may want to consult this article on the transition from DUNS to the Unique Entity ID. Ensure your SAM.gov and Grants.gov registrations and passwords are current. It may take up to one month to register or reactivate your registration with SAM.gov and Grants.gov. NHPRC will not grant deadline extensions for lack of registration.",Synopsis 1,Yes,,Darrell.Meadows@nara.gov,NHPRC Acting Deputy Director,Darrell Meadows&lt;br/&gt;Darrell.Meadows@nara.gov,http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/announcement/editions.html,"Link to full grant announcement, including additional requirements",,

A central theme or well-defined major objective is the foundation of a P01 program project. Compared to the narrower thrust of a traditional R01 research project, a program project is directed toward a range of scientific questions that elucidate various aspects of the central theme. The interrelationships of research projects and collaborations among investigators will yield synergy and results beyond those achievable if each research project were to be pursued independently. In addition, one or more shared research cores are required. The project leaders and core leaders should be established investigators with strong records of innovative research and independent funding support.

These studies at the exploratory stage are intended for the development of experimental capabilities and/or theoretical frameworks in preparation for a future competition for larger-scale or extended efforts, including the BRAIN TargetedBCP R01 or the multi-component, Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Programs (U19). The overall goal of this FOA is to enable a large-scale analysis of neural systems and circuits within the context and during the simultaneous measurement of an ethologically relevant behavior. Toward this end, teams are expected to assemble and leverage multi-disciplinary expertise, and to integrate experimental with computational and theoretical approaches. Teams are expected to bridge fields by incorporating rich information on cell-types, on circuit functionality and connectivity, in conjunction with sophisticated analyses of an ethologically relevant behavior of an organism or a well-defined neural system. Teams are also expected to aim for a mechanistic understanding of the circuits of the central nervous system (CNS) by applying cutting-edge methods such as those for large-scale recording, manipulation, and analysis of neural circuits across multiple regions of the CNS.",Synopsis 1,No,07202024,grantsinfo@nih.gov,See Section VII.

The purpose of this Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative is to encourage applications that will develop and validate novel tools to facilitate the detailed analysis and manipulation of complex circuits and provide insights into cellular interactions that underlie brain function. Critical advances in the treatment of brain disorders in human populations are hindered by our lack of ability to monitor and manipulate circuitry in safe, minimally-invasive ways. Clinical intervention with novel cell and circuit specific tools will require extensive focused research designed to remove barriers to delivery of gene therapies. In addition to identification and removal of barriers, the need to specifically target dysfunctional circuitry poses additional challenges. Neuroscience has experienced an impressive influx of exciting new research tools in the past decade, especially since the launch of the BRAIN Initiative. However, the majority of these cutting edge tools have been developed for use in model organisms, primarily rodents, fish and flies. These cutting edge tools, such as viral delivery of genetic constructs, are increasingly adaptable to large brains and more importantly are emerging as potential human therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. A pressing need to develop tools for use in large brains, more directly relevant to the human brain is the focus of this initiative. The new tools and technologies should inform and/or exploit cell-type and/or circuit-level specificity. Plans for validating the utility of the tool/technology will be an essential feature of a successful application.",Synopsis 1,No,07132024,grantsinfo@nih.gov,See Section VII.
